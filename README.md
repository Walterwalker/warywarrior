Oh no Again!
But this time with a huge loss.....

I have the habit of sleeping in the bus while going to my university classes....worst thing is my university is 10 mins away from my house by bus.

I have missed first class of an important subject which I am planning to take since January and now they wont let me enter any more.

Huge loss!


then i got an idea!

how about creating an alram which alerts you when you enter a certain area...sounds better right?

if I had this kind of alarm, I wouldnt have missed my deep learning class.

I have a bit of experience in writing notifications for Xiaomi MI Band, so this project aims at creating a notification and an alarm when you enter 
a particular area which can be preset.


This project will be developed in 24hours.
